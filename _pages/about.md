Hi! I'm Kai Moltzen, research associate at the [AIX Artificial Intelligence and Explainability group](https://www.leuphana.de/en/institutes/iis/artificial-intelligence-and-explainability.html) guided by [Prof. Ricardo Usbeck](https://www.leuphana.de/en/institutes/iis/persons/ricardo-usbeck.html) at [Leuphana University LÃ¼neburg](https://www.leuphana.de/en/).

### Research Focus
I am interested in all things related to Geospatial Artificial Intelligence (GeoAI), in particular GeoSemantics trying to interpret the spatial information described in natural language. Being associated with the AIX group, I am naturally also excited to make GeoAI methods explainable, especially by using Geospatial Knowledge Graphs.
