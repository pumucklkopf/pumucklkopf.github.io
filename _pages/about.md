Hi! I'm Kai Moltzen, a Research Associate at the [AIX Artificial Intelligence and Explainability group](https://www.leuphana.de/en/institutes/iis/artificial-intelligence-and-explainability.html) guided by [Prof. Ricardo Usbeck](https://www.leuphana.de/en/institutes/iis/persons/ricardo-usbeck.html) at [Leuphana University LÃ¼neburg](https://www.leuphana.de/en/) in Germany.

I am interested in all things related to Geospatial Artificial Intelligence (GeoAI), in particular GeoSemantics trying to interpret the spatial information described in natural language. Being associated with the AIX group, I am naturally also interested in making GeoAI methods explainable, especially by using Geospatial Knowledge Graphs.

Great to see you here! If you want to get in touch, feel free to reach out via email or connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kai-moltzen/).
