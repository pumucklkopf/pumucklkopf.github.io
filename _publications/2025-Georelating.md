Accurately identifying disaster-affected areas is crucial for datadriven disaster resilience. In response, we introduce Georelating,
a task that infers affected areas from textual reports containing complex locative expressions, moving beyond traditional geoparsing
approaches that rely on explicit point locations. Georelating instead combines resolving unnamed regions and reasoning about
spatial relations to represent event-affected areas within standardized Discrete Global Grid Systems (DGGSs).

We propose addressing Georelating with a pipeline capitalizing on the contextual understanding of large language model (LLM)
agents to perform geospatial reasoning. Preliminary evaluation highlights the potential of this approach for the foundational geocoding
stage and the novel Georelating task. We point out future paths for enhancing Georelating systems toward intuitive and efficient
disaster information systems.
