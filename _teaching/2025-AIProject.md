Project-oriented undergraduate course for business informatics students to apply AI methods to real-world problems. Students will work in teams to identify a problem, design an AI-based solution, implement it, and present their results.

I co-teach this course with [Dr. Debayan Banerjee](https://www.leuphana.de/institute/iis/personen/debayan-banerjee.html) and [Prof. Ricardo Usbeck](https://www.leuphana.de/institute/iis/personen/ricardo-usbeck.html).
